    "In this exericise, you will work with a fairly large dataset and do some modeling and predictions using Spark Machine Learning. The dataset being used is the 2013 NYC Taxi Dataset [https://archive.org/details/nycTaxiTripData2013](https://archive.org/details/nycTaxiTripData2013). The original dataset consists of two files, `trip_data` and `trip_fare`, which need to be merged to create the dataset for modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "The merge has already been performed and stored as a parquet file on S3 because there were some data issues that were not covered in class. The workbook [merge-fare-and-trip-data-create-parquet.ipynb](merge-fare-and-trip-data-create-parquet.ipynb) contains code for creating the merged set (for reference.)\n",

    "This is an interactive PySpark session. Remember that when you open this notebook the SparkContext and SparkSession are already created, and they are in the sc and spark variables, respectively. You can run the following two cells to make sure that the Kernel is active.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not insert any additional cells than the ones that are provided for assignment submission. You may add cells as you work through the notebook, but you need to delete extra cells and keep the initial structure.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some tips you may want to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You may consider saving intermediate datasets (i.e. training and testing) when you first create them. To save intermediate datasets, save them as **parquet** files in your own S3 bucket. To save, use the following code: `df.write.parquet(\"s3://[[your-s3-bucket]]/data_location/\", mode=\"overwrite\")`.\n",
    "* You may also want to save a model object in S3 after you train it, especially if training takes a while. To save a model object, use the following code: `model.save(\"s3://[[your-s3-bucket]]/model_location/\")`\n",
    "* When creating the Machine Learning pipelines, you may want to try it first on a minuscule sample of your training data to make sure the pipelines work as planned. To create a tiny DataFrame, use the `limit` method: `df.limit(100)` (this creates a small DataFrame with the first 100 rows from df.)"
